# Verilog_HDLBits
For the first time, I’m making a repository because I genuinely want to— not just to have something on GitHub. I will try to upload all the solutions of the code that I submit on HDLBits.I think it will be a good practice for me, and who knows, maybe someone will find it useful. I'm not really expecting much, but hey, you gotta start somewhere, right? HDLBits seems like a good place to cut my teeth and get some practice in. I'm hoping to keep things organised and easy to follow, so hopefully my code won't be too messy. Wish me luck!

I am not merging the branches right now. If interested, feel free to check out other branches as well to see all the work till now. I am not very active on this.
