Case statements in Verilog are nearly equivalent to a sequence of if-elseif-else that compares one expression to a list of others. Its syntax and functionality differs from the switch statement in C.

always @(*) begin     // This is a combinational circuit
    case (in)
      1'b1: begin 
               out = 1'b1;  // begin-end if >1 statement
            end
      1'b0: out = 1'b0;
      default: out = 1'bx;
    endcase
end
The case statement begins with case and each "case item" ends with a colon. There is no "switch".
Each case item can execute exactly one statement. This makes the "break" used in C unnecessary. But this means that if you need more than one statement, you must use begin ... end.
Duplicate (and partially overlapping) case items are permitted. The first one that matches is used. C does not allow duplicate case items.


Problem:
Case statements are more convenient than if statements if there are a large number of cases. So, in this exercise, create a 6-to-1 multiplexer. When sel is between 0 and 5, choose the corresponding data input. Otherwise, output 0. The data inputs and outputs are 
all 4 bits wide.

Solution:
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module ( 
    input [2:0] sel, 
    input [3:0] data0,
    input [3:0] data1,
    input [3:0] data2,
    input [3:0] data3,
    input [3:0] data4,
    input [3:0] data5,
    output reg [3:0] out   );//

    always@(*) begin  // This is a combinational circuit
        case(sel)
            3'd0: out = data0;
            3'd1: out = data1;
            3'd2: out = data2;
            3'd3: out = data3;
            3'd4: out = data4;
            3'd5: out = data5;
            default: out = 3'b000;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
