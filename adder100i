Problem: Create a 100-bit binary ripple-carry adder by instantiating 100 full adders. The adder adds two 100-bit numbers and a carry-in to produce a 100-bit sum and carry out. To encourage you to actually 
instantiate full adders, also output the carry-out from each full adder in the ripple-carry adder. cout[99] is the final carry-out from the last full adder, and is the carry-out you usually see.


Solution:

module fa( 
    input a, b, cin,
    output cout, sum );
    
//    assign sum = a^b^cin;
//    assign cout = ((a&b) | (b&cin) | (a&cin));
    assign {cout, sum} = a+b+cin;

endmodule

module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output [99:0] cout,
    output [99:0] sum );

    fa i_0 (a[0], b[0], cin, cout[0], sum[0]);
    genvar i;
    generate
        for (i=1; i<100; i++) begin: ab   // Naming the block in generate statement
          /*  fa i0 (.a(a[i]), 
                   .b(b[i]), 
                   .cin(cout[i-1]), 
                   .cout(cout[i]), 
                   .sum(sum[i]));
                   */
            fa i0 (a[i], b[i], cout[i-1], cout[i], sum[i]);
        end
    endgenerate

endmodule
